### How it works ?
Welcome to the world of Message Boards :-)

There is 2 program for using sunsend:

1. Server Side Program (backend): A program that can provide the chat system
2. Client Side program (frontend): A program that can provide a interface for using server side program

For sending messages, you need to specify the special channel, each channel has some ID that you can find in the API documentation (in progress)

This repo is a server side Rest API that provide the chat system, if you wanna just use the chat in your website, you need to see the client repo (in progress)

For more things, you can checkout TODO.md
